We have finished all 3 parts in task2.

For the first part, we aggregated and compared important features including age, location, type between users who clicked and all users.

For the second part, we developed a random forest model after generating dummy variables with high difference between users who clicked and all users.

For the last part, we used a GAN model to generate synthesized data.
